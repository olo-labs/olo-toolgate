# Tool SDK specification (design gate D0)

## Purpose

This is the normative authoring contract for the ToolGate Tool SDK. Every SDK, in every language and in both runtime modes, **must** implement exactly what these files say. The design rationale is in [plan.md](../../docs/sdk-plan/plan.md); where wording differs, these files win for the SDK.

## Rules

- Key words **must**, **must not**, **should** and **may** are normative.
- A file here changes only through an amendment to [ADR 019](../../docs/adr/019-tool-sdk-authoring-contract.md), which reopens gate D0.
- Examples are illustrative; tables and grammar blocks are normative.
