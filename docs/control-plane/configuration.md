# Control Plane configuration and operations

The required external inputs are PostgreSQL and an identity provider issuing RS256
access tokens. There is no built-in password database, default account or generated
production credential. Directory users describe the organization; they do not create
identity-provider users or change their token roles. Disable/revoke IdP accounts in
the IdP. Directory changes require explicit signed bundle publication to reach
Gateway. See [publication, trust configuration and operations](policy-bundles.md).

| Environment variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_JDBC_URL` | PostgreSQL JDBC URL; production requires `sslmode=verify-full` and a trusted CA |
| `QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_USERNAME`, `QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD` | Dedicated runtime login, member of `toolgate_control_runtime` |
| `QUARKUS_FLYWAY_USERNAME`, `QUARKUS_FLYWAY_PASSWORD` | Separate schema owner/migration login |
| `MP_JWT_VERIFY_PUBLICKEY_LOCATION` | Local mounted PEM RSA public key, at least 2048 bits; no signing key |
| `MP_JWT_VERIFY_ISSUER` | Exact HTTPS identity-provider issuer |
| `MP_JWT_VERIFY_AUDIENCES` | Dedicated administrative access-token audience |
| `TOOLGATE_CONTROL_MAX_RECORDS` | Active records across all kinds per tenant, 1–512; default 512 |
| `TOOLGATE_CONTROL_MAX_CONFIG_BYTES` | Serialized record bytes per tenant, 1024–1048576; default 1 MiB |
| `TOOLGATE_CONTROL_DEVELOPMENT_MODE` | Default false; explicit isolated local tests may use PostgreSQL without TLS |
| `QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT`, `QUARKUS_MANAGEMENT_PORT` | Defaults 8082 and 9092 |
| `TOOLGATE_CONTROL_TRACE_EXPORT_ENABLED` | Default false; enable sanitized outbound traces at runtime |
| `QUARKUS_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` | Explicit trusted collector URL; use HTTPS in production |
| `QUARKUS_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_PROTOCOL` | `grpc` (default) or `http/protobuf` |

Tokens require signed `sub`, `tenant_id`, `groups`, `iat` and `exp` claims. A token's
maximum lifetime and age are 900 seconds, with no expiry skew or future issue time.
Groups `toolgate-reader` and `toolgate-admin` may read directory/export/OpenAPI data;
only `toolgate-admin` may mutate, import or read audit entries. Tenant identity never
comes from a request body or header. Invalid identity claims fail closed.
Rotate verification keys through an explicitly coordinated IdP/key mount rollout.
There is no discovery/JWKS fetch, key cache or interactive login flow in Module 02.

Only 8082 belongs behind a trusted HTTPS ingress/proxy. Keep 9092 private to probes
and authorized monitoring. Proxy header forwarding and CORS are disabled. Do not
expose either internal cleartext listener directly to an untrusted network.
`/q/health/live`, `/q/health/ready` and `/q/metrics` run on 9092. Database loss makes
readiness fail and APIs return `DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE`, without leaking SQL errors.
Logs contain fixed status/failure code, safe application call site, server request ID and trace ID; request bodies, identities,
tokens, paths and query strings are excluded. W3C `traceparent` propagates through
Quarkus/OpenTelemetry. Audit request IDs correlate with response headers and logs.
Before any configured span exporter receives data, an SDK customizer reduces spans
to trace IDs, timing, status, a fixed name, HTTP method/status and server request ID.
Raw URLs, paths, query strings, events, links, exception descriptions and trace-state
values are removed. SDK unit and real OTLP protobuf receiver tests verify this boundary.
The image builds the `cdi` exporter; runtime export remains disabled unless explicitly
enabled. Exporter selection is a build-time setting in
[Quarkus 3.40](https://quarkus.io/version/3.40/guides/opentelemetry/).

Requests are limited to 2 MiB, headers to 16 KiB, data nesting to 32, and pages to
100 entries. Each replica has a 16-connection pool with a 3-second acquisition
deadline. SQL and tenant-lock deadlines are 5 and 3 seconds, with a 10-second
driver socket deadline. Shutdown drains for 20 seconds; the chart allows 30 seconds.
Restrict ingress connections/rates at the organization edge. These are administrative
APIs, not the Gateway authorization hot path.

Startup refuses missing auth inputs, weak keys, identical migration/runtime logins
and runtime permission to change audit entries or create schema. Provision the
NOLOGIN role `toolgate_control_runtime` before migrations. The migrator owns the
dedicated database and `public` schema; the runtime login inherits the migration
grants only. Production migrators do not need `CREATEDB`; the isolated test helper
uses it to create fresh databases for clean-install/upgrade proofs. Supply credentials
via a secret manager/Kubernetes Secret, never the chart values or repository.

Use [deployment and upgrades](upgrades.md) for HA, migration and recovery. For a 503,
check database connectivity/TLS, NetworkPolicy DB/DNS peers, pool pressure and
readiness. For a 401, check issuer/audience/key, token claims and clock synchronization.
For a 409, refresh revisions and validate references, retired IDs and tenant quotas.
Do not bypass these checks to make a deployment ready.

Module 05 approval behavior defaults disabled. Enable bundle signing and set the
four `TOOLGATE_CONTROL_APPROVAL_*` fields in [approval configuration](approvals.md).
The dedicated approver role and signed `user_id` cannot be replaced by admin role.

## Client check-in (specification, design gate D1)

> **Status: frozen specification, not yet available.** This section is a design gate D1
> artifact. It is implemented in milestone M1. None of the variables below are read by
> the current release. Source: [Tool SDK plan §17.1 and §17.2](../sdk-plan/plan.md).

Today one value controls every client check-in. Control returns `nextIntervalMs` in
the check-in reply and currently hard-codes it to 500
(`apps/control-plane/src/main/java/io/ololabs/toolgate/control/application/EndpointService.java:190`).
The endpoint client accepts any value from 500 ms to 1 hour and rejects anything else
(`apps/endpoint-client/src/service.rs:859-865`). The client opens its WebSocket only
after a poll delivers a job.

### Five settings, not one

| Setting | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Heartbeat interval | Liveness, inventory and status reports |
| Job notification transport | How a device learns a job exists: WebSocket push (preferred) or fallback poll |
| Job pickup timeout | How long a queued job may wait for its device before it expires, or is re-queued if idempotent |
| Execution deadline | Per tool, from the manifest, capped by the platform ceilings |
| Offline threshold | When a device counts as unavailable |

A WebSocket disconnect is not device unavailability. A dropped socket puts the device
in `DEGRADED` for a grace period, with fallback polling. Non-idempotent leased jobs
must never be rescheduled to another device because of a socket drop; they go to
`OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` at lease expiry. Only queued, not-yet-leased jobs may move, and only
if the binding allows it.

### Phase A variables (no client change)

Phase A makes the existing value configurable and works with clients already deployed.

| Environment variable | Meaning | Quickstart | Enterprise default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TOOLGATE_CONTROL_CLIENT_CHECKIN_MS` | Value sent as `nextIntervalMs`; must be 500 to 3600000 | 500 | 2000 |
| `TOOLGATE_CONTROL_CLIENT_CHECKIN_JITTER_PCT` | Random spread added to each interval, in percent | 0 | 20 |
| `TOOLGATE_CONTROL_CLIENT_OFFLINE_AFTER_MS` | Time without a check-in before a device counts as offline | 120000 | max(120000, 6 × check-in) |

In Phase A an idle device only learns of a job at its next check-in, so the check-in
value is the job pickup latency.

**Validation rule.** Check-in plus its maximum jitter plus a 5 second execution margin
must not exceed the 30 second synchronous call deadline. If it does, Control must
refuse to start with a named configuration error, rather than run with a value that
makes synchronous client tools time out. Longer client work must use durable tasks.

**Where it is set.** Helm values `control.clientCheckIn.checkInMs`,
`control.clientCheckIn.jitterPct` and `control.clientCheckIn.offlineAfterMs`. M1 adds
them to `deploy/helm/olo-toolgate/values.schema.json`; they are not in the chart yet.
These are environment-owned values: the console shows the effective values read-only
under Configuration > Device (see [Configuration menu](configuration-menu.md)) and
they cannot be changed through the settings API or configuration import.

### Phase B variables (future, needs a client release)

Phase B is not part of M1. It makes a persistent WebSocket the steady state, with
server push for jobs, permission changes and kill entries. Older clients keep Phase A
behavior. Planned variables:

- `TOOLGATE_CONTROL_CLIENT_SOCKET_MODE` (`persistent`)
- `TOOLGATE_CONTROL_CLIENT_HEARTBEAT_MS` (enterprise 30000)
- `TOOLGATE_CONTROL_CLIENT_FALLBACK_POLL_MS` (used only while the socket is down)
- `TOOLGATE_CONTROL_CLIENT_JOB_PICKUP_TIMEOUT_MS`
- `TOOLGATE_CONTROL_CLIENT_SOCKET_GRACE_MS`

For scale: idle load at 10,000 devices is about 20,000 requests/s at 500 ms polling,
5,000 at 2 s (Phase A), and about 333/s of heartbeats at 30 s (Phase B).
