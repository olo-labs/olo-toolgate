# Foundation compatibility and upgrades

The initial contract release is `0.1.0-dev`, wire schema major `v1`, Java 21,
Rust 1.94.1, TypeScript 5.9.3 and PHP 8.2+. No runtime component or prior stable
release is claimed compatible. The release bundle includes `compatibility.json`.

Contract versions use SemVer. Breaking accepted inputs, wire shapes or security
meaning requires a major contract version and compatibility review. Compatible
new independent models may use minor versions. Metadata/generator corrections
that preserve behavior may use patch versions. Pre-1.0 breaking changes require
an explicit minor version and upgrade notes; do not disguise them as patches.

Unknown fields are rejected by security object schemas. An optional new field
may still break an old closed reader; negotiate a new wire revision or capability
and maintain both revisions during the support window. Frozen fixtures must
never be rewritten simply to make a breaking change pass. New model fixtures
may be added separately. Signing formats, verification, policy lifecycles and
actual package reconciliation are implemented by their later owning modules.

There is no database migration, running workload, HA behavior or cluster upgrade
to test in this foundation. The Helm chart has no rendered resources and its
default and upgrade renders must both remain empty. Chart `version` tracks the
product version and `appVersion` names that product version; contract versions
are independently recorded in the compatibility matrix. No fake deployment is
created to make chart installation appear functional.

Release artifacts are immutable. Fix a published defect with a new version.
Rollback of a foundation library means selecting the previous compatible package
version; there is no runtime rollout procedure yet. Stable N/N-1 runtime support
will be defined and tested before a stable product release.
