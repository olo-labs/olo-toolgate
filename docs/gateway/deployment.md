# Gateway deployment and operations

`python tools/gateway/container.py` builds the production Gateway and runs actual native effects against a fresh group-only installation. The gate verifies current discovery, signed effect consumption, exact retries, live revocation, authority outage, non-root/read-only runtime, separate management and graceful shutdown. `tools/control/container.py` separately verifies two production Control replicas sharing PostgreSQL and independent configuration review. These are owned disposable containers; no existing deployment or database is reset.

Use [online configuration](configuration.md), purpose-separated external keys and verified HTTPS between Gateway and Control. The isolated loopback fixture transport is explicitly identified in reports and is not a production TLS claim. Runtime and restricted management listeners remain separate. Readiness observes Core within five seconds, while each protected effect checks current authority directly.

`python tools/enterprise/helm.py` validates install/upgrade manifests and rejects missing custody, untrusted authority URLs and retired local policy/approval settings. Kubernetes execution and organizational network/TLS provisioning are separate deployment responsibilities; a manifest render does not establish cluster availability or enterprise capacity.

Inspect bounded reason/correlation IDs, readiness, metrics and [revocation/recovery runbooks](../enterprise-access-control/operations.md). Do not print workload tokens, raw arguments, secret values or signed bearer capabilities in operational diagnostics.
