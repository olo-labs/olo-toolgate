## Module Completion Table Template

Copy into the module PR/commit note:

```text

| ARC-001 | COMPLETE | ... |
| SEC-001 | COMPLETE | ... |
| K8S-001 | NOT_APPLICABLE | library-only module |

A `BLOCKED` requirement means the module is not DONE.

## Module evidence

- Module 00: [pre-implementation coverage plan](modules/00-coverage.md) and
  [completion matrix and verification evidence](modules/00-completion.md).
  The foundation classifies all 104 unique IDs: 49 COMPLETE and 55 NOT_APPLICABLE
  with scope reasons. Remote publication is configured for protected CI only.
- Module 01: [pre-implementation coverage plan](modules/01-coverage.md) and
  [completion matrix and verification evidence](modules/01-completion.md).
  Gateway Core classifies all 104 unique IDs: 87 COMPLETE and 17 NOT_APPLICABLE
  with scope reasons. The three template example rows above are not extra
  requirements. Image/Helm publication remains protected CI only.
- Module 02: [pre-implementation coverage plan](modules/02-coverage.md) and
  [completion matrix and verification evidence](modules/02-completion.md).
  Control Plane Backend classifies all 104 unique IDs: 95 COMPLETE and 9
  NOT_APPLICABLE with scope reasons. Real PostgreSQL/HTTP/OTLP, container scan
  and two-replica Kind install/upgrade/rollback pass. Remote publication remains
  protected CI only.
- Module 03: [pre-implementation coverage plan](modules/03-coverage.md) and
  [completion matrix and verification evidence](modules/03-completion.md).
  Admin UI Foundation classifies all 104 unique IDs: 88 COMPLETE and 16
  NOT_APPLICABLE with scope reasons. Real PostgreSQL/Control browser E2E,
  accessibility, production embedding, scans and Kind upgrade/rollback pass.
  Remote publication remains protected CI only.

- Module 04: [pre-implementation coverage plan](modules/04-coverage.md) and
  [completion matrix and verification evidence](modules/04-completion.md).
  Signed policy bundles classify all 104 unique IDs: 101 COMPLETE and 3
  NOT_APPLICABLE with scope reasons. Real JCA/ring/PostgreSQL production-image
  E2E, rotation/outage/expiry/recovery, local Maven proof, scans/SBOMs and
  two-replica signed publication/Helm upgrade/rollback pass. Protected releases
  require the new policy compatibility gate; no remote publication was performed.

- Module 05: [pre-implementation coverage plan](modules/05-coverage.md) and
  [completion matrix and verification evidence](modules/05-completion.md).
  ASK approvals classify all 104 unique IDs: 102 COMPLETE and two NOT_APPLICABLE.
  Real PostgreSQL/production signed-permit E2E, browser accessibility, local Maven,
  scans/SBOMs and two-replica upgrade/rollback pass. Protected release compatibility
  gates include approval behavior; remote publication remains CI only.

- Module 06: [coverage plan](modules/06-coverage.md) and [verification report](modules/06-completion.md). In progress: 101 BLOCKED and 3 NOT_APPLICABLE; commit records current work without claiming definition-of-done completion.

- Module 07: [pre-implementation coverage](modules/07-coverage.md) and
  [verification report](modules/07-completion.md). Implementation includes fixed
  HotFolder/built-ins, fresh Gateway protection, system-service logout independence,
  and anonymous three-OS downloads. There are 99 COMPLETE, two BLOCKED and three
  NOT_APPLICABLE IDs; native service-manager CI must execute before declaring DONE.

- Module 08: [pre-implementation coverage](modules/08-coverage.md) and
  [verification report](modules/08-completion.md). Managed local OCI runtimes and
  first-use provisioning are implemented; Batch/CMD and native OS/ARM runtime
  certification remain BLOCKED. Its historical report records the Module 08 scope.

- Module 09: [pre-implementation coverage](modules/09-coverage.md) and
  [verification report and individual matrix](modules/09-completion.md).
  Signed immutable releases, desired generations, canaries, reconciliation,
  rollback/uninstall, artifact grants and Packages UI are implemented for the
  checked Linux path. Native Windows/macOS/ARM certification and fleet-enabled
  cluster routing remain BLOCKED. Module is NOT DONE; its historical report retains the certification blockers.

- Module 10: [pre-implementation coverage](modules/10-coverage.md) and
  [verification report/individual matrix](modules/10-completion.md). Custom tool
  authoring, signed designated-client sandbox testing, immutable organization
  packages, independent release/deployment and publication preparation pass the
  real Linux path. 84 COMPLETE, 4 BLOCKED and 16 NOT_APPLICABLE IDs; native
  system-engine/logout/boot and ARM certification remain open. NOT DONE; no Module 11.

- Module 11: [pre-implementation coverage](modules/11-coverage.md) and
  [verification report/individual matrix](modules/11-completion.md). Linux/amd64
  non-HA Quickstart passes real Gateway/SQLite/UI/ASK/mTLS/bootstrap, persistence,
  upgrade and backup/restore gates. 84 COMPLETE, 20 NOT_APPLICABLE, zero
  module-scope BLOCKED IDs. Earlier native certification remains open; remote
  publication is protected CI-only. No Module 12 is started.
