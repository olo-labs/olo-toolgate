# Local debug stack

Double-click `start.bat` to test the working tree, build Control and Quickstart
with the production Dockerfiles, smoke-test the new image, then start the console
at http://127.0.0.1:18090/console/. `restart.bat` repeats the checks and build
before replacing the container. `stop.bat` stops this stack and preserves data.
Scripts work from any current directory and never commit or push.

Requires Docker Desktop running Linux containers, Git, Node.js/npm, Python 3.11+
and internet access for dependencies and base images. A Python environment is
created under `.dev/debug/venv`. The matching Playwright Chromium browser is
installed automatically after npm dependencies. Supply real client release assets under
`deploy/client-assets/release` as required by the existing Quickstart build.
Errors stop deployment and remain visible in the console; failed checks leave
the running debug stack untouched.

The default gates cover generated contracts, CI regression tests, headers,
contract validation, UI types/unit tests, Chrome extension tests, Windows and
Linux download browser tests, and real Quickstart boot/ASK/enrollment/persistence
smoke tests. Build uses current files including uncommitted changes.

For the broader foundation and security scan gates run `start.bat -FullCheck`
(or `restart.bat -FullCheck`). Install the toolchains used by `tools/check.py`:
Java 21, Gradle, Rust 1.94.1, PHP and Helm, and make them available on PATH.
Cross-platform installer builds, signing, release publication, hosted CI and
Kubernetes jobs still run in their respective CI environments; these scripts
do not replace every workflow job.

This is a separate Compose project (`toolgate-debug`) using the local
`olo-toolgate-quickstart:debug` image and its own persistent volume. It does not
pull published ToolGate images or stop the stack on port 18089. Login is enabled
by default. Read bootstrap credentials using
`docker compose -p toolgate-debug -f debug/compose.yaml logs quickstart`.
For local password-free testing set `TOOLGATE_DISABLE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=true` in
your environment before launching a script. Ports bind only to localhost.

Validate Docker/Compose configuration without building:
`powershell -NoProfile -File debug/manage.ps1 start -ValidateOnly`.
Inspect failures with `docker compose -p toolgate-debug -f debug/compose.yaml logs`.
No script deletes volumes; back up `/data` before testing migrations.
