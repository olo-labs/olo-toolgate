# Changelog

All notable project changes should be documented here.

The project follows semantic versioning once stable versioning begins.

## 0.10.0-dev

- A fresh Windows install enrolls with the gateway it was downloaded from. Uninstall
  parks the focused gateway's enrollment in its profile, and setup parks an enrollment
  an older uninstall left behind (or retires it when that gateway was recreated), so the
  earlier gateway stays connected in the background instead of being inherited.

- Windows setup downloaded from a console installs and connects in one step: it skips
  the gateway and repair/uninstall questions when the download names its gateway, and
  enrollment no longer reports an error when a reinstall resumed an enrollment.
  Uninstall is complete: it removes every gateway enrollment, the device key, logs and
  remembered gateways and CAs (`uninstall --purge`).

- Connect in the console starts a fresh enrollment when the client is already pointed
  at that gateway but its enrollment no longer works (revoked, or offline after an
  immediate check-in), including after switching back to a gateway that has forgotten
  the device. The new request still needs approval (`reenroll` command).

- Keep the Windows client connected to every gateway it has enrolled with. Switching
  gateways moves focus (and the tray icon color) instead of disconnecting; Show status
  has a Status and Activity log tab per gateway headed with its name and URL. Gateways
  send their name, initialized from `TOOLGATE_GATEWAY_NAME` and editable under
  Configuration, in enrollment and check-in replies.

- Add a live branded Windows tray status window, command activity/progress,
  protected bounded device history and an About/version menu. Require license
  acceptance in the interactive Windows installer.

- Consolidate enterprise completion into sequential source, native, browser,
  Gateway, PostgreSQL, restore, deployment, SDK and image checks. Trace all 96
  acceptance scenarios to named evidence, retaining missing or skipped gates.
  Make Linux custody, PostgreSQL runtime and reviewed restore mandatory in CI;
  keep Quickstart alive through dependency health-check outages.

- Enterprise intermediary checkpoint: replace individual ACLs and local ALLOW with
  complete group grants, live Control authority, single-use bound effect permits,
  durable budgets and outcomes, scoped runtime secret delivery, independent
  configuration/reconciliation review and signed restore quarantine. Add migration
  shadow evidence, production replica checks and current group administration UIs.
- Remove retired active contract models, static-policy setup and obsolete test
  producers. Older development clients/configuration writers must be upgraded;
  legacy authority is archived and requires explicit reviewed group conversion.
  Earlier entries below describe historical features superseded by this change.

- Verify automatic membership audit transactions in HTTP smoke and SQLite tests,
  give the Compose test Gateway a readiness probe, and handle local Quickstart
  images without attempting registry pulls.

- Gate CI builds on release metadata and generated bindings, with regression tests
  for stale release notes, missing files, newline drift and version changes.

- Manage named roles with fixed capability templates and JSON device/tool scopes,
  direct and team-inherited assignments, guarded role changes, retained-state
  migrations, grouped console submenus and administrative audit browsing.

- Add directory editors, disabled registration defaults, transactional default-team
  and policy membership, multiple teams, administrative roles and combined privilege
  templates with device-group policy scopes and last-Super-Admin protection.

- Match shared OLO logo branding and favicon, default to dark with saved
  Dark/Light/System themes, and expand login/client downloads to a responsive
  full-width layout with accessible theme palettes.

- Fix Quickstart Tool Builder and Packages for the persistent default administrator
  in both login modes: verified internal TLS, dedicated fleet/release signing
  custody, and bounded local content-addressed package downloads.

- Add managed Compose stacks with default/external PostgreSQL, authenticated Redis,
  and an isolated password-free local Quickstart. Quickstart supports bounded
  embedded/external Redis catalog caching and a real external PostgreSQL adapter.
- Keep password login enabled by default; explicit local mode auto-enters the UI
  while signed API sessions, Gateway policy and ASK remain enforced. Add option
  verification, PostgreSQL/vault restart and browser CI smoke with runtime notices.

- Add unsigned Windows setup, macOS disk-image installer and Linux service launcher
  for x64/ARM64, checksummed anonymous downloads and native installer CI smoke.

- Publish development binaries, tested Docker Hub images and uniquely versioned
  Maven contracts after all same-commit main CI gates pass.
- Include generated release notes, Apache-2.0 license and project notices in native
  archives, contract libraries and containers; preserve dependency notices/SBOMs.

- Add the one-image non-HA Quickstart with real Gateway/Control/console,
  transactional SQLite, persistent `/data`, forced password change and separate
  generated identity/policy/permit/device/vault keys.
- Add protected built-in execution, exact-scope ASK, encrypted name-only vault,
  verified anonymous Windows/macOS/Linux downloads and direct mTLS enrollment.
- Add checksummed offline backup/restore, schema upgrade tests, production/debug
  runbooks and protected image publication with scans, SBOM and provenance.

- Add custom local tool authoring with code/runtime/schema/AI metadata,
  permission/resource/credential declarations and bounded secret scanning.
- Add durable signed designated-client sandbox tests and immutable organization
  packages, independent offline release signing, deployment and publication preparation.
- Add fixed inline Python/Node/PowerShell/Shell runners inside existing OCI
  confinement; Control never executes author code. Native platform certification
  limits remain explicit in the Module 10 report.

## 0.9.0-dev

- Add independent signed package releases, device-scoped desired generations and
  mTLS artifact grants backed by immutable external HTTPS descriptors.
- Add durable canary assignments, reported-state aggregation, update/rollback and
  uninstall with atomic client activation after confined runtime health checks.
- Add Packages console, external signing/store Helm references, production/debug
  runbook and lifecycle/security gates. Native execution certification limits from
  Module 08 remain explicit; no unsupported host runtime fallback is introduced.

## 0.8.0-dev

- Add canonical JSON local invocation and IPC revision 3, managed image preparation,
  fixed runtime vectors, online Gateway binding and disposable OCI resource isolation.
- Add first-use interpreter provisioning from approved immutable images; host Python
  is unnecessary. Document external engine, Batch/CMD/WASM and native CI limitations.
- Add malicious real-runtime fixtures, health/counters, cleanup and runtime operations.

## 0.7.0-dev â€” Module 07

- Add protected HotFolder tools with capability-relative paths, no-follow links,
  extension/size limits, atomic writes, bounded events and fixed safe utilities.
- Require ready enrolled identity and fresh Gateway authorization on every call;
  bind copy/move to both paths and consume approved ASK permits online.
- Add anonymous Windows/macOS/Linux downloads, real native archive validation,
  checksum/SBOM/license packaging, six-target native service CI and release hooks.
- Preserve system-service operation across logout/lock; fix prerequisite enrollment
  timestamp, endpoint routing, TLS build configuration and Windows custody handling.
- See Module 07 verification for executed checks and outstanding release gates.

## 0.6.0-dev â€” Module 06 in progress

- Add canonical endpoint enrollment, discovery, identity, check-in and IPC models.
- Add Rust protected-service/CLI foundations, local key custody, bounded OS IPC,
  ordered durable reports and fail-closed offline/revoked health.
- Add Control enrollment/certificate issuer, browser confirmation, mTLS check-in,
  revocation, audit and PostgreSQL migration V5; add native build/package skeleton.
- Module 06 completion gates remain open; see its verification report.

## 0.5.0-dev â€” Module 05

- Add exact-operation ASK review with dedicated approver identity, one-time and
  temporary grants, deny, durable expiry, transaction races and audited state.
- Add format-2 signed ASK policies, runtime v2, separate Gateway RS256 permits and
  strict PostgreSQL-backed jti consumption. Approval outage/revocation blocks.
- Add approval console, external Helm keys/configuration, migration V4 and genuine
  contract, browser, production E2E, release compatibility and operational gates.
